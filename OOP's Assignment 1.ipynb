    "Q1. Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode of file opening?\n",
    "Ans1. The open() function is used to open a file in Python. The open() function returns a file object that can be used to read, write, and manipulate the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The different modes of opening a file are:\n",
    "\n",
    "r (Read mode): This mode is used to open a file for reading. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file. If the file does not exist, an error is raised.\n",
    "w (Write mode): This mode is used to open a file for writing. If the file already exists, its contents are truncated. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.\n",
    "a (Append mode): This mode is used to open a file for appending. The file pointer is placed at the end of the file. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.\n",
    "x (Exclusive creation mode): This mode is used to open a file for exclusive creation. If the file already exists, an error is raised.\n",
    "b (Binary mode): This mode is used to open a file in binary mode, which is used for non-text files like images, videos, etc.\n",
    "t (Text mode): This mode is used to open a file in text mode, which is used for text files.\n",
    "+ (Read and write mode): This mode is used to open a file for both reading and writing.\n",

    "Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "Ans2. The close() function is used to close an open file in Python. When a file is opened using the open() function.\n",
    "(i) Closing a file releases the resources that were allocated to it. If you don't close a file, it will continue to occupy system resources until the program terminates, which can lead to performance issues.\n",
    "(ii) Closing a file ensures that all the data that was written to it is properly flushed to disk. If you don't close a file, some of the data that was written to it may still be in memory and may not have been written to disk yet. This can result in data loss or corruption.\n",

The advantage of using with statement and open() together is that it automatically takes care of closing the file after the block of code is executed, even if an exception is raised during the execution of the block.\n",
